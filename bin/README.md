# The `bin` directory

You should put your scripts in this directory. All the tests will assume
this is where your scripts live, and will likely fail if you put them
somewhere else. Make sure you make them executable as well.

When you've completed the lab, this should contain:

* `assemble_report.sh`
* `create_country_dist.sh`
* `create_username_dist.sh`
* `create_hours_dist.sh`
* `process_client_logs.sh`
* `process_logs.sh`
* `wrap_contents.sh`
